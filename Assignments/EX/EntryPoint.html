                <p class="p">In a world where flying through the sky is as simple as riding a bicycle, the sport "Flying Circus" is all the rage.
                    Following the discovery of anti-gravitons,<br> special shoes that allow an individual to fly, Anti-Graviton Shoes, took the world by storm.
                    And with the Grav Shoes came an entirely new world for people to explore.<br> Not long after, that revolution in technology gave birth to a brand new sport, <br><br>Flying Circus, which used shoes to make players compete in the open sky.
                    Hinata Masaya, who was once considered a prodigy,<br> turned his back on Flying Circus after suffering a crushing defeat, although there was also another reason...
                    <br>However, his former passion is reignited while teaching the new transfer student, Kurashina Asuka, how to fly.
                    This time, <br>Masaya chooses to enter the world of Flying Circus not as a player, but as a coach. Sometimes fighting, and at other times encouraging each other, <br>he and his team decided to challenge the top student-athletes in Japan.
                    Now, with Asuka by his side, how high will he be able to fly?<br>
                    This is a love story about those who met through the sky, as well as the friends who surround them.
