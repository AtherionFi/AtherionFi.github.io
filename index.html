            <p class="p">In a world where flying through the sky is as simple as riding a bicycle, the sport "Flying Circus" is all the rage.
                Following the discovery of anti-gravitons,<br> special shoes that allow an individual to fly, Anti-Graviton Shoes, took the world by storm.
                And with the Grav Shoes came an entirely new world for people to explore.<br> Not long after, that revolution in technology gave birth to a brand new sport, <br><br>Flying Circus, which used shoes to make players compete in the open sky.
                Hinata Masaya, who was once considered a prodigy,<br> turned his back on Flying Circus after suffering a crushing defeat, although there was also another reason...
                <br>However, his former passion is reignited while teaching the new transfer student, Kurashina Asuka, how to fly.
                This time, <br>Masaya chooses to enter the world of Flying Circus not as a player, but as a coach. Sometimes fighting, and at other times encouraging each other, <br>he and his team decided to challenge the top student-athletes in Japan.
                Now, with Asuka by his side, how high will he be able to fly?<br>
                This is a love story about those who met through the sky, as well as the friends who surround them.

                <p>They say I'm a guy who doesn't understand human emotions at all.
                    But really, who actually does?<br>
                    The start of summer:
                    Aiuchi Shuuta, a second year at Hokumakidai Academy, is the smartest student in his grade.<br><br> However, he loses this title for the first time.
                    A girl, Arimura Romi, climbed her way to the top,<br> while continuing to publish cutting-edge research papers online. She's a very mysterious girl:<br> the textbook definition of an enigma.
                    And thus, Shuuta seeks Romi's help on a certain matter.                    
                    "Aiuchi Shuuta" and "Arimura Romi"<br>
                    It all started from the meeting of these two geniuses-- a distant summer adventure begins.
